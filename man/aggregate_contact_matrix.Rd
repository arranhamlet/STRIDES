\title{Aggregate a Square Contact Matrix to Custom Age Groups}
\usage{
aggregate_contact_matrix(
  mat,
  age_breaks,
  weights = NULL,
  method = c("weighted.mean", "sum")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A square numeric matrix where both rows and columns correspond to single-year ages (e.g., 0:100).}

\item{age_breaks}{A numeric vector of age cut points (e.g. `c(0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, Inf)`).}

\item{weights}{Optional numeric vector of length equal to `nrow(mat)` (e.g., population by age).
Required if `method = "weighted.mean"`.}

\item{method}{Aggregation method. One of `"weighted.mean"` (default) or `"sum"`.}
}
\value{
A square matrix of size `(length(age_breaks) - 1)` aggregated by age group.
}
\description{
Aggregates a contact matrix (e.g., 101x101 for ages 0â€“100) into a smaller square matrix
according to custom `age_breaks`. Optionally applies population weighting.
}
