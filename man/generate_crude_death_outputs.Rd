\title{Generate Aggregated Crude Death Output}
\usage{
generate_crude_death_outputs(preprocessed, weight_reformatted, age_breaks)
}
\arguments{
\item{preprocessed}{A list-like object containing processed demographic data, including `population_data` and `crude_death`.}

\item{new_age_breaks}{A numeric vector defining the new age group breaks (e.g., c(0, 1, 5, 15, 50, Inf)).}

\item{time_factor}{A numeric value used to convert annual crude death rate to model timestep (e.g., 365 for daily).}
}
\value{
A list with aggregated crude death data and comparison of total deaths.
}
\description{
This function computes the aggregated crude death rates from a preprocessed demographic dataset,
using weighted average rates across new age bands. It also computes the total number of deaths before
and after aggregation to check for consistency.
