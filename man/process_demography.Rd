\item{population_all}{A data frame of total population counts by single year of age (0–100) and year.}

\item{population_female}{A data frame of female population counts by single year of age (15–49) and year.}

\item{contact_matricies}{A named list of 16x16 contact matrices by country ISO3 code.}

\item{iso}{A three-letter ISO country code.}

\item{year_start}{First year to include.}

\item{year_end}{Final year to include.}

\item{n_age}{Number of collapsed age bins to use in the model.}

\item{number_of_vaccines}{Number of vaccine doses considered.}

\item{n_risk}{Number of risk strata in the model.}

\value{
A named list of processed demographic inputs.
}
\description{
This function processes raw demographic data—covering migration, fertility, mortality,
population counts, and age-specific contact matrices—into a structured format suitable for use
in an age-, vaccination-, and risk-structured infectious disease transmission model.
}
\details{
The function uses tidyverse conventions and assumes consistent
naming of age columns (e.g., `x0` to `x100` for all population counts).
