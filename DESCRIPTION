Description: 
    PREVAIL is an R package designed to support dynamic, adaptable, and comprehensive 
    transmission modeling for vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), particularly in crisis 
    settings where routine immunization services are disrupted. Developed using the odin2 
    framework, PREVAIL enables stochastic, age-structured, and risk-structured disease 
    transmission models that account for routine immunization, supplemental campaigns, 
    and waning immunity. The package is tailored for humanitarian use cases, such as 
    refugee settings or conflict zones, where the probability of outbreaks is high and 
    intervention strategies must be robust and responsive. It includes flexible input 
    handling, realistic population dynamics, and tools to project cases, attack rates, 
    and impact of delayed or proactive vaccination campaigns. PREVAIL is supported by 
    Community Jameel and builds on work funded by the FCDO for mortality rate modeling 
    in Gaza.
